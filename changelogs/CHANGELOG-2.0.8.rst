Changelog for version 2.0.8
===========================

Bitbucket integration
#####################

This was painful but it is finally done - gitcd's review and status commands work now with bitbucket as well as with github.

Still to do
###########

Unfortunately, the tool is still not able to open pull requests on upstream repositories for forks, I might tackle this in the upcoming release as well as gitlab integration - stay tuned.
